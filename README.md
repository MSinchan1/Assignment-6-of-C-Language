47.	Write a program, which reads an integer and prints another integer. In the output all even digits are retained and odd digits are removed. e.g. input 23145 output 24.
48.	Write a program, which reads an integer (n) and n digits of a number (integer) in reverse order. The program outputs the number. e.g. n=5 and digits are 3 2 5 1 2 the output is  21523.
49.	Write a program, which reads two integers a and b and outputs a/b correct to 5 places of decimal. The program should not use any float variable or “%f”. (assume a<b) 
50.	Write a program, which reads a float number (between 0 and 1)  and prints the sum of its first five digits. e.g. input 0.231562 output 2+3+1+5+6  = 17.
51.	Write a program, which reads an integer (n) and n digits of a float number (between 0 and 1) in correct order. The program outputs the number. e.g. n=5 and digits are 3 2 5 1 2 the output is  0.32512.
52.	Write a program which reads a float x (between 0 and 1) and outputs a float y. Every digit of y is one more than the corresponding digit in x. e.g. input 0.23156 output 0.34267. We assume that all digits of x are less then 9.
1.	
int x,k,i,sum=0;
scanf("%d%d",&x,&k);
for (i=1;i<=k;i++)
{  sum=sum+(x%10);

}
printf("%d ",sum);
	2.

scanf("%d",&x);
do
{  d=x%10;

} while (x>0);
	3.	
int x,d,y=0,t=1;

        t=t*10;  }
    x=x/10;   }
